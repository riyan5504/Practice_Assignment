        <span>Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the <b>brain, reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.</b><br>

            <br>Since ashwagandha is traditionally used as an adaptogen, it is used for many conditions related to stress.<br>
            Adaptogens are believed to help the body resist physical and mental stress. Some of the conditions it is <br>
            used for <strong>include insomnia, aging, anxiety and many others,</strong> but there is no good scientific evidence to support<br>
            most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ashwagandha for<b> COVID-19</b>.<br>
            
            <br>Don't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry. Also, don't confuse <br>
            ashwagandha with American ginseng, Panax ginseng, or eleuthero.
